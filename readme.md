This is a my base setup for Sinatra, Rspec and Twitter Bootstrap.

I use chruby, but if you don't feel free to remove the .ruby-version and .rvm file (if you aren't using rvm)

To get running, run

```
git clone https://github.com/jmkelly/sinatra-rspec-bootstrap.git
cd sinatra-rspec-bootstrap
bundle install
ruby application.rb
```

Then open http://localhost:4567/
